This application provides images to be used as markers on a map or as button icons.

The GET parameters define the color in RGB and also the size of the image to be
returned. At the moment this application provides route, area and needle icons.

e.g..
/needle?color=33ff00&scale=2.0 --> returns a needle scaled to double size and color #33ff00
/area?color=33ff00&scale=2.0 --> returns an area scaled to double size and color #33ff00
/route?color=33ff00&scale=1.0 --> returns a route of original size and color #33ff00

To use this app install it with the following command:
python setup.py install

After that you need to add gntimages to INSTALLED_APPS and import 
the gntimages.urls to your urls settings.

The app works by giving color and scale as get parameters 'color' and 'scale'.
The color should be given in hexadecimal representation and scale as a float.
