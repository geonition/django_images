This application provides needle images to be used as markers on a map. The 
needle images can also be used as icons on buttons or other places as
required.

The GET parameters define the color in RGB and also the size of the image to be
returned. This application is only ment to porvide map markers but the idea
can of course be used to procide other types of images too.

To use this app install it with the following command:
python setup.py install

After that you need to add gntimages to INSTALLED_APPS and import 
the gntimages.urls to your urls settings. Also make sure the png images 
'base_needle.png' and 'needle_color.png' is copied to you MEDIA_ROOT
path.

The app works by giving color and scale as get parameters 'color' and 'scale'.
The color should be given in hexadecimal representation and scale as a float.
